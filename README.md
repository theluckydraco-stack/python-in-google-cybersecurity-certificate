# Python in Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate

This repository contains structured Python practice completed alongside the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate.
The exercises progressively apply core Python concepts to security-focused scenarios such as login monitoring and log analysis.

## Purpose
This repository is used to:
- Strengthen core Python fundamentals
- Build modular functions using return statements and conditionals
- Practice structured problem-solving
- Apply basic automation logic to security-focused scenarios

## Concepts Covered So Far

1. Failure rate calculations using functions and return statements  
2. Reading rate analysis with conditional logic  
3. Login behavior analysis and ratio comparison  
4. String operations (type casting, slicing, indexing, `.index()`)  
5. List synchronization (users + devices), membership validation, and access control logic  
6. Regular expressions (regex) for device pattern matching, IP extraction, and basic log scanning  

## Current Script

- practice.py — contains all structured learning sections (1–6) in progressive order

## How to Run
python3 practice.py

## Goal

The long-term goal is to transition from basic scripting to building small security-focused tools such as:

- Login anomaly detectors  
- Log parsers  
- IP filtering utilities  
- SOC-style mini analyzers  

This repository documents that progression in a structured and incremental way.
